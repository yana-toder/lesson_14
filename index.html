								What’s Your Horoscope This Week?
								Astrologer Alice Bell forecasts for love, money, career, 
								style and more every Tuesday. This week you will be continuing 
								to build upon whatever was started around the Scorpio solar eclipse 
								on 25 October. From Monday through Wednesday the moon is moving through 
								Aquarius, coming into contact with Saturn. You may have a heavier workload 
								and numerous responsibilities to attend to, but fortunately you will feel more 
								grounded and focused.

					On Thursday and Friday, the moon will move through Pisces and 
					meet up with Jupiter. You may be emotionally sensitive, or you could 
					be feeling everything more intensely than usual. On the other hand, you 
					might get a positive boost of energy, or be optimistic and open minded to 
					hearing about different opinions and beliefs. You could also be leaning into 
					your creativity, or be more prone to daydreaming and following your intuition. 
					Finally, you may have the urge to be compassionate and giving towards others.

					You may be emotional about money this week, Capricorn, with the moon in Aquarius. 
					Numerous expenses might be popping up, or you could be splurging on clothing or 
					beauty products. You may also be putting energy into work projects or building a 
					business, and you may be asserting your own ideas at your job. As the moon moves 
					into Pisces later this week, you could be reading a lot, journalling, or teaching 
					yourself a new skill. You may also be meeting up with friends, and you will be
					excited to mingle and trade ideas with people.
